## Code Appetizers
Code Appetizers are programming problems to help review the previous lecture.

## Code Workshops
These are mini-projects that put all the syntax and skills into a project. You'll see how everything comes together. 
These workshops have a natural progression as new skills are learned. You will find different and often better ways to solve problems you previously encountered. There are many ways to approach each mini-project. The idea is to practice programming and to help get ready for your final project.
